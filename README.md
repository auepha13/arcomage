Arcomage is the greatest Card game ever.
We built it in java


Setup:
Download the repository.
Create a database in pgadmin / postgresql named 'arcomage'
Restore the database from the 'arcomage.backup' file located in the res folder.


Start the 'starter.java'.
You can play one Card per round.
The cards have certain effects and cost - you will get additional resources every round.
You win if your Tower is 100 big or the other tower is at 0.

Play the card with a left click and discard it with a right click.

Have fun
